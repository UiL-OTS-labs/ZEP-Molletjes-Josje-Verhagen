# ZEP-Molletjes-Josje-Verhagen
Experiment that shows visual stimuli and plays soundfiles in triplets. At the onset of each audio simulus a mole is shown. 
At the third and final audiostimulus the visual stimulus changes positively if the participant correctly presses a button.
No negative feedback is provided. The experiment also registers the participants reaction time when they press a button during when they use a button-box.

Triplets are generated according to a rule set and randomised.
